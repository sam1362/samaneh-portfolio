          We learned that understanding caregiversâ€™ real needs through empathy and collaboration
          is key to creating meaningful, supportive healthcare solutions.

          The project journey was a creative exploration of caregiver challenges and solutions,
          building on Helsenorge as a trusted healthcare platform to improve usability and relevance
          for caregivers. Key insights revealed the emotional burdens and stress caregivers face,
          the difficulty of accessing reliable health information, and the lack of tailored support tools.
          To address these, we adopted a user-centered approach through direct engagement with caregivers,
          an iterative design process shaped by feedback, and a design thinking mindset that emphasized
          empathy and problem-solving.

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          The proposed solutions included a centralized caregiving section, personalized tools for
          stress reduction and support, and community networks that enable caregivers to share experiences.
          Ultimately, collaboration, empathy, and innovation guided the process, resulting in solutions that
          both empower caregivers and enhance the overall value of Helsenorge.
